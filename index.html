    <article id="Greek Potatoes">
    <h2>Greek Potatoes</h2>
    <img src="images/Greek%20Potatoes.jpg" alt="Greek Potatoes">
    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>8  large potatoes, peeled, cut into large wedges (about       6-7 wedges per potato)</li>
        <li>4  garlic cloves, minced </li>
        <li>1⁄2 cup olive oil</li>
        <li>1  cup water</li>
        <li>1  tablespoon dried oregano</li>
        <li>1  lemon, juiced</li>
        <li>sea salt</li>
        <li>fresh coarse ground black pepper</li>
    </ul>
    
    <h3>Directions:</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>Preheat oven to 420&deg;F A reviewer has suggested           spraying the baking pan with Pam 
        </li>
        <li>Put all the ingredients into a baking pan large enough to     hold them.
            Season generously with sea salt and black pepper.
            Put them in the pan and give everything a toss to distribute.
            The garlic will drop into the water/oil solution but its flavour will permeate the potatoes, and this way, it won't burn.
  		</li>
        <li>Bake for 40 minutes.
            When a nice golden-brown crust has formed on the potatoes, give them a stir to bring the white underside up, season lightly with a bit more sea salt and pepper and just a light sprinkling of oregano.
            Add 1/2 cup more water if pan appears to be getting dry, and pop back into oven to brown other side of potatoes.
            This will take about another 40 minutes.
            Do not be afraid of overcooking the potatoes- they will be delicious. 
        </li>
    </ol>
